Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The main goal of this project is to build a decision tree classifier that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. We will use the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Steps Involved:

1.Data Loading and Preprocessing:

2.Data Splitting:

3.Model Training:

4.Model Evaluation:

5.Visualization:

Outcome:
The project will provide insights into the factors influencing customer purchases and allow for easy interpretation of decision-making through the visual representation of the decision tree. This can be particularly useful in marketing strategies and understanding customer behavior.
